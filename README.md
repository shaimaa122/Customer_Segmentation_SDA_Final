# Customer segmentation -  *Shaima Alharbi*  

## Setup:

- Libraries: 
   You will need to have numpy, pandas, seaborn,sklearn and matplotlib.

-  Data:
   the data set is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/vetrirah/customer) and can be downloaded from this [repo](https://github.com/shaimaa122/Customer_segment/blob/main/Train.csv). 
  
- [Data Dictionary](https://github.com/shaimaa122/Customer_segment/blob/main/Customer%20Segmentation%20-%20Data%20Dictinory.pdf)

## Overview:
Customer segmentation is the practice of dividing customers into groups of individuals that are similar in specific ways relevant to marketing, such as age, gender, interests and spending habits.
The Customer segmentation helps the company to know the customers thatâ€™s leads to success the business. 

In this project I will apply the idea by classify the customers into four segmentations (A, B, C, D) based on Age, work exp, family size and more

## Process:
## 1- Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA):
Exploratory data analysis step is to data cleaning, explore data type, visualize the data, find the relation between the features and Segmentation(target), data distribution, mean and standard deviation, and etc, i figured / I noticed:

   - Most of the customers are in `D` segmentation, Least of the customers are in `B` segmentation,and the customers in `A` and `C` segmentations are close to each other.
   - Most of the customers are Male,The `D` segmentation contains the most Males & Female and the `B` segmentation contains the least Males & Female because the numbers of Customers in `D` is more than in `B`
   - Most of the customers are Married, The `D` segmentation contains the most of unmarried customer, and the other segmentations (`A`,`B`,`C`) contains most of married special `C`.
   - The most Profession is Artist and the least Profession is Homemaker, The `C` , `A` and `B` segmentations contains most of the Artist, but The `D` segmentation contains most of the Healthcare.
   - The age of customers is very important the `D` contain Customers between 20 - 30,So contains the most of unmarried, most of ` A`  between 27 - 40, most of` B` between 30 - 50 and most of `C` between 40 - 50, So contains the most of married.
   - Most of the customers have one year experience, and least of customers have more than 10 years experience.
   - Most of customers spending Low score and least of customers spending high, Most of `D` segmentation is spending Low, because their ages less than 30, Most of `C` segmentation is spending Average, , because their ages more than 40.
   - Most customers have Family size of 2 , Most of customers have  Family size of 9
   - The most of Customers in category Cat_6, The least of Customers in Cat_5 and Cat_1

**At the end of EDA:**
- `The A Segmentation`:
     
    contain the most of married Customers and spnding score is Low becouse thair age is less than 40 , and the Profession is Artists.
- `The B Segmentation`:

   contain the less number of customers and thair age more than 30 and less than 50, So most of customer is married.
- `The c Segmentation`:

   contain the most of married Customers and spnding score is Average becouse thair age is more than 45 , and the Profession is Artists.
- `The D Segmentation`:

   contain the most of unmarried Customers and spnding score is low Customers becouse thair age is less than 30 , and the Profession is Homecare.

Note: You can see all the visualisation in [EDA repo](https://github.com/shaimaa122/Customer_segment/tree/main/EDA)

## 2- Extract Featuures:
   - Categorical Features: 
      - Convert the binary columns into 0,1
      - Convert categorical variable into dummy/indicator variables.
   - Derived Features:
      - Add new features to improve the score:
        `Age_range` - Classify the customers based on their age ( less than 30, less than 45, less than 60, more than 60)
        
        
## 3- Modelling:
   In this project, I [scale](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler.html) the numerical columns(`Age`,`Family size `,`Work Experience `) and [split](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split.html) data then I use classfications models: 
   - `Baseline Model`: 
      predict the most common class
   - [`Logistic Regression`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html?highlight=logistic%20regression#sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression)
   - [`Decision Tree Classifier`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier.html?highlight=decision%20tree%20classifier#sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier)
   - [`Random Forest Classifier `](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html?highlight=random%20forest%20classifier#sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier)
   - [` KNN Classifier`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier.html?highlight=kneighbors#sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier)
   - [`SGD Classifier`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.SGDClassifier.html?highlight=sgd%20classifier#sklearn.linear_model.SGDClassifier)
   - [`Stacking Classifier`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.StackingClassifier.html?highlight=stacking%20classifier#sklearn.ensemble.StackingClassifier)

### Compare Models
![Compare Models](https://github.com/shaimaa122/Customer_segment/blob/main/compare%20models%20with%20grid.png)

- Compare these models to the `Baseline Model`, I noticed that Baseline showed the lowest accuracy score with 0.28606
- The classfications models with accuracy score :
   - `Logistic Regression` is 0.50656
   - `Decision Tree Classifier` is 0.43505
   - `Random Forest Classifier ` is 0.4889
   - ` KNN Classifier` is 0.47552
   -  `SGD Classifier` is 0.47663
   -  `Stacking Classifier `is 0.5217
- The best score compared to baseline is **Stacking model**
   
- At the end,Optmize the Stacking model by using GridSearchCV with best params and the acurrcy is 0.52888
